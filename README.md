# Ultimate Plus, by Sentor_G
This is a variant of the [Ultimate IronMON](https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1#ultimate-ironmon-ruleset) ruleset, created by [iateyourpie](https://www.twitch.tv/iateyourpie). It includes the rules from [Standard](https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1#standard-ironmon-ruleset) as well.
<br><br>
In Pokémon Platinum, the [smart AI randomiser](https://github.com/PyroMikeGit/SuperKaizoIronMON/blob/main/README.md#smart-ai-rom-patches) is used to apply smart AI to all trainers. For other games, there are [patches](https://github.com/PyroMikeGit/SuperKaizoIronMON?tab=readme-ov-file#smart-ai-rom-patches) to be applied to the ROM in order to make the trainers have smart AI.
### Changes/Additions:

| **Rule** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Catch or Kill 1 per Route | No wild fainting **at all** if you did not catch something on the Route. |
| No Legendaries | Legendaries and Mythicals are now unbanned from appearing in the wild. You may use only one "restricted Pokémon" per seed.

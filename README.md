# Ultimate Plus, by Sentor_G
This is a variant of the **[Ultimate IronMON](https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1#ultimate-ironmon-ruleset)** ruleset, created by **[iateyourpie](https://www.twitch.tv/iateyourpie)**. Also including the rules from **[Standard](https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1#standard-ironmon-ruleset)**.
<br><br>
In Pokémon Platinum, the **[smart AI randomiser](https://github.com/PyroMikeGit/SuperKaizoIronMON/releases/tag/smart-ai-v2)** is used to apply smart AI to all trainers. For other games, there are **[patches](https://github.com/PyroMikeGit/SuperKaizoIronMON?tab=readme-ov-file#smart-ai-rom-patches)** to be applied to the ROM in order to make the trainers have smart AI.
